# **App Name**: PillWise

## Core Features:

- Medication Entry: Users can enter medications with details like name, dosage, frequency, and special instructions.
- Smart Scheduling: Generative AI algorithm learns user behavior to optimize medication reminder schedules, suggesting the best times based on patterns of adherence and daily routines. The model serves as a tool for adjusting reminders.
- Dose Logging: Users can log doses as 'Taken' or 'Skipped', recording the action time. The application keeps track of trends and generates a log.
- Adherence Summaries: Present a summary of adherence over a given time. Initially shown as one number, the summary can be expanded to show greater detail on request.
- Caregiver Data Access: Allow secure data sharing with caregiver (not implemented initially, but the function will stub out a permissions process in the UI)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calming Blue (#5DADE2) for a trustworthy and health-focused feel.
- Background color: Soft Light Blue (#EBF5FB), desaturated, providing a clean and gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Gentle Teal (#45B39D), creating contrast and drawing attention to key interactions.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a modern, humanist sans-serif, will be used throughout the application for headlines and body text.
- Use clear, outlined icons to represent medication types and actions. Use the Google Material Design icon set for consistency.
- A clean, card-based layout will present information in an organized, easy-to-digest manner. Content will be clearly divided to avoid overwhelming the user.
- Subtle transitions and animations will be used to confirm actions and guide the user through the app. A minimalist style should be maintained.
